# GoQMW
RESTful API written in GOLANG for providing and logging vehicle session data. Essentially a backend to interfaces like [PyBus](https://github.com/MrDoctorKovacic/pyBus).

## Requirements
* Go v1.11 at a minimum ([Raspberry Pi Install](https://gist.github.com/kbeflo/9d981573aad107da6fa7ac0603259b3b)) 

## Installation 

Having [InfluxDB & the rest of the TICK stack](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/running-the-tick-stack-on-a-raspberry-pi/) is recommended, although this will run fine without them.

```go get github.com/MrDoctorKovacic/GoQMW/```
